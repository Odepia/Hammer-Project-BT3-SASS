## Hammer's new Cache feature

When you're building a site, compilation time is very important - especially if you're working with large projects.

We're proud to announce that the new version of Hammer has a super new feature. Internally, Hammer now caches your compiled project. When you change one of your files, Hammer only compiles and updates that file - saving you time!

Internal testing has shown this new feature to make Hammer _up to 50x faster_ than previous versions. It's really very fast.

## Something not quite right?

This new feature is still under development, so if you notice any bugs or strange behaviour, please email [support@hammerformac.com](support@hammerformac.com "Hammer's support") and we'll take a look.

If you need to clear the cache for any reason, press the "**Rebuild Now**" button in the Hammer UI to clear the cache and build from scratch.
