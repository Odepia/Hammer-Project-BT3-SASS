## Markdown & HAML

You can use **[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown")** to markup text and use **[HAML](http://haml.info/ "HAML")** for the templates in your Hammer projects.

Hammer compiles both Markdown `(.md)` and HAML `(.haml)` files into HTML. For Hammer to automatically compile these, just make sure the file extensions are present.

You can also use Markdown and HAML as includes: `<!-- @include myhamlfile -->` Remember to drop the file extension like you would for an HTML include.
