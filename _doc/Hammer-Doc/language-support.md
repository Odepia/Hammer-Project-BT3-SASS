# ![](img/icon-small.png) Language Support

## What languages does Hammer support?

Hammer is designed with generating markup quickly and effectively in mind, and we support a number of preprocessor languages. We support only the languages that make sense to us and we'd encourage every front-end developer to take the time to learn them.

In most cases you don't need to do anything for the languages shown below to compile, Hammer will take care of that for you.
